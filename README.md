- **Slow, not recommended to be used upon loading time.**
- **Un-reliable, there's about 1000 better ways to do this. Feel free to improve anything you want.**

Same idea as using IDA.

1. Set the string referenced to the subroutine
2. Set the *call* number of the sub_XXXXX you need (within the .text margin).
3. Output -> Done.
